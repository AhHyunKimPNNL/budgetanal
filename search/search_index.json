SciDAC project Motivation Phase 1 project: finding the source of error in the Energy Earth System Model (E3SM) and other global atmospheric models, especially the time integration errors in the subgrid parameterizations of atmospheric physics. Phase 2: improve the multi-time-scale process coupling while keeping the computational cost affordable. a stochastic formulation of the turbulence parameterization from the angle of accurately representing theeffects of fast processes using large timesteps. 2. About E3SM CAM vs EAM EAM (the E3SM (Energy Exascale Earth System Model) Atmosphere Model) was forked from the the Comunity Atmosphere Model (CAM; Neale et al., 2010) version 5.3. Independent development of EAM began around June 2014 with the goal of producing a tool optimized for Department of Energy (DOE) scientific and computational needs. The E3SM project is focused on modeling and assessment of environmental change occuring over the last 40 years and next 40 years in these research areas: 1. the water cycle - water cycle extremes: e.g., hurricanes, midlatitude cyclones, atmospheric rivers - water variability and availability (storms, storm tracks, blocking, snowmelt) - sea level rise issues (especially topography associated with Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet) 2. Sea level rise 3. Exploratory studies of the nitrogen and phosphorus on land biogeochemistry (BGC) Compared to CAM5.3, E3SM has: higher vertical resolution (30 levels to 72 levels) the surface layer is 20 m thick, with 15 layers between the surface and 850 hPa to better capture thin clouds, sharp gradients at top of the boundary layer, rapid changes in process rate (autoconversion, accretion, evaporation, and radiative heating rates) and cloud properties (drop size and rain rates) between 850 hPa and 500 hPa vertical grid spacing is slowly increased from 100 to 500 m to represent the variations in water vapor features and aerosol plumes that are frequently observed at scale of 500 m and less. free troposphere (above 500 hPa) up to the lower stratosphere (70 hPa) was increased from 1200 to 600 m to allow for adequate representation of upward propagating large-scale tropical waves such as Kelvin and mixed-Rossby gravity. improved treatment of some diabatic processes: Turbulence, shallow convection, and stratoform cloud macrophysics (CLUBB) and the improved representation of ice clouds (threshold size for autoconversion of ice to snow particle is a function of temperature) aerosol-cloud (stratiform and shallow convective clouds) interaction when CLUBB and MAM4 are coupled some stratospheric ozone COSP (the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project Obseration Simulator Package; Bodas-Salcedo et al., 2011) version 1.4 Time inetgration in EAM Atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) are mainly consist of two distinct parts: the dynamical core and the physics parameterizations.Consider the general prediction equation for a generic variable \\(\\psi\\) , (1) \\(\\frac{\\partial \\psi} {\\partial t}\\) = \\(D\\left(\\psi\\right)\\) + \\(P\\left(\\psi\\right)\\) ;, \\(\\psi\\) : a prognostic variable (e.g., temperature, horizontal wind component) D: The dynamical core component P: the physical parameterization suite A hybrid physics-dyanmics coupling that uses different methods for fluid dynamics and tracer transport (Lauritzen et al., 2014) is used in EAM. (????not sure??? need more understanding on this) This method is also called as many names: \"isolated sequential splitting\" (Wan et al., 2021), \"time splitting method\" (Williamson, 2002; Lauritzen et al., 2018), \"sequential-update splitting\" (Donahue and Caldwell, 2018), and \"operator splitting\" (Sportisse, 2000). The Time Split coupling is approximated by (2) \\(\\psi^* = \\psi^{n-1} + 2\\Delta t D(\\psi^*,\\psi^{n},\\psi^{n-1}) \\;,\\) (3) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = \\psi^* + 2\\Delta t P(\\psi^{n+1},\\psi^*) \\;\\) . the time split approximations D and P are calculated sequentially, each based on the state produced by the other. In other words, a model component takes the atmospheric state variables (e.g., winds, temperature, pressure, and tracer concentrations that have already been updated by a proceding component) as inputs. Tendencies caused by the current component are calculated by considering the current component in isolation. The tendencies are then used to update the atmospheric state before passing it to the next component. EAMv1 has \"physics time step\" of 30 minutes and \"sub-cycling timestep\" of 5 minutes. Within one physics time step, the atmospheric state is updated multiple times. The schematic diagram for the time integration is as follows: The focus points of the dyanmical core and physics parameterization developmenets are different. The dynamical core developments focuses on designing accurate and computationally efficient discretization methods for modern computing architectures (see, e.g., Lauritzen et al., 2011; Williamson, 2007). In contrast, the development of physics parameterizations has a stronger emphasis on how to formulate the equations to conceptually describe a physical phenomena. For that reason (?), a number of recent studies have shown that time integration errors in the parameterizations or process coupling can be sufficiently large to dominate the total error of the numerical solutions (e.g., Barrett et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2012, 2018).

(????not sure??? need more understanding on this) This method is also called as many names: \"isolated sequential splitting\" (Wan et al., 2021), \"time splitting method\" (Williamson, 2002; Lauritzen et al., 2018), \"sequential-update splitting\" (Donahue and Caldwell, 2018), and \"operator splitting\" (Sportisse, 2000).

In other words, a model component takes the atmospheric state variables (e.g., winds, temperature, pressure, and tracer concentrations that have already been updated by a proceding component) as inputs. Tendencies caused by the current component are calculated by considering the current component in isolation. The tendencies are then used to update the atmospheric state before passing it to the next component. EAMv1 has \"physics time step\" of 30 minutes and \"sub-cycling timestep\" of 5 minutes. Within one physics time step, the atmospheric state is updated multiple times. The schematic diagram for the time integration is as follows: The focus points of the dyanmical core and physics parameterization developmenets are different. The dynamical core developments focuses on designing accurate and computationally efficient discretization methods for modern computing architectures (see, e.g., Lauritzen et al., 2011; Williamson, 2007). In contrast, the development of physics parameterizations has a stronger emphasis on how to formulate the equations to conceptually describe a physical phenomena. For that reason (?), a number of recent studies have shown that time integration errors in the parameterizations or process coupling can be sufficiently large to dominate the total error of the numerical solutions (e.g., Barrett et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2012, 2018).

The numerics of physical parametrization Coupling of Dynamical Core and Parameterization Suite in CAM5 Link for the documentation The CAM5.0 cleanly separates the parameterization suite from the dynamical core , and makes it easier to replace or modify each in isolation. The dynamical core can be coupled to the parameterization suite in a purely time split manner or in a purely process split one, as described below. Consider the general prediction equation for a generic variable \\(\\psi\\) , (1) \\(\\frac{\\partial \\psi} {\\partial t}\\) = \\(D\\left(\\psi\\right)\\) + \\(P\\left(\\psi\\right)\\) ;, \\(\\psi\\) : a prognostic variable (e.g., temperature, horizontal wind component) D: The dynamical core component P: the physical parameterization suite A three-time-level notation is employed which is appropriate for the semi-implicit Eulerian spectral transform dynamical core. However, the numerical characteristics of the physical parameterizations are more like those of diffusive processes rather than advective ones. They are therefore approximated with forward or backward differences, rather than centered three-time-level forms. The Process Split coupling is approximated by (2) \\(\\psi^{n+1}\\) = \\(\\psi^{n-1} + 2\\Delta t D(\\psi^{n+1},\\psi^{n},\\psi^{n-1}) + 2\\Delta t P(\\psi^*,\\psi^{n-1}) \\;,\\) where \\(P(\\psi^*,\\psi^{n-1})\\) is calculated first from (3) \\(\\psi^* = \\psi^{n-1} + 2\\Delta t P(\\psi^*,\\psi^{n-1}) \\;.\\) The Time Split coupling is approximated by (4) \\(\\psi^* = \\psi^{n-1} + 2\\Delta t D(\\psi^*,\\psi^{n},\\psi^{n-1}) \\;,\\) (5) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = \\psi^* + 2\\Delta t P(\\psi^{n+1},\\psi^*) \\;\\) . The distinction is that in the Process Split approximation the calculations of D and P are both based on the same past state, \\(\\psi^{n-1}\\) , while in the Time Split approximations D and P are calculated sequentially , each based on the state produced by the other. As mentioned above, the Eulerian core employs the three-time-level notation in eq. (2)-(5). Eqns. (2)-(5) also apply to two-time-level finite volume, semi-Lagrangian and spectral element (HOMME) cores by dropping centered n term dependencies, and replacing n-1 by n and \\(2 \\Delta t\\) by \\(\\Delta t\\) . The parameterization package can be applied to produce an updated field as indicated in Eq. (3) and Eq. (5). Thus Eq. (5) can be written with an operator notation (6) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = {\\boldsymbol{P}}\\left(\\psi^*\\right) \\;\\) , where only the past state is included in the operator dependency for notational convenience. The implicit predicted state dependency is understood. The Process Split equation (2) can also be written in operator notation as (7) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = {\\boldsymbol{D}}\\left(\\psi^{n-1}, \\frac {{\\boldsymbol{P}}(\\psi^{n-1})-\\psi^{n-1}} {2 \\Delta t} \\right) \\;\\) , \\(\\psi^{n-1}\\) : the prognostic variable input to the dynamical core \\(\\frac {{\\boldsymbol{P}}(\\psi^{n-1})-\\psi^{n-1}} {2 \\Delta t} ;\\) : the forcing rate from the parameterization package (e.g. the heating rate in the thermodynamic equation). Again only the past state is included in the operator dependency, with the implicit predicted state dependency left understood. With this notation the Time Split system (4) and (5) can be written (8) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = {\\boldsymbol{P}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{D}}\\left(\\psi^{n-1},0\\right)\\right) \\;\\) . The total parameterization package in CAM5.0 consists of a sequence of components, indicated by (9) \\(P = \\{ M,R,S,T \\} \\;\\) , M: (Moist) precipitation processes R: clouds and Radiation S: the Surface model T: Turbulent mixing. Each of these in turn is subdivided into various components: M includes an optional dry adiabatic adjustment (normally applied only in the stratosphere), moist penetrative convection, shallow convection, and large-scale stable condensation; R first calculates the cloud parameterization followed by the radiation parameterization; S provides the surface fluxes obtained from land, ocean and sea ice models, or calculates them based on specified surface conditions such as sea surface temperatures and sea ice distribution. These surface fluxes provide lower flux boundary conditions for the turbulent mixing T which is comprised of the planetary boundary layer parameterization, vertical diffusion, and gravity wave drag. Defining operators following (6) for each of the parameterization components, the couplings in CAM5.0 are summarized as: TIME SPLIT (10) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = {\\boldsymbol{T}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{S}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{R}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{M}}\\left( {\\boldsymbol{D}}\\left(\\psi^{n-1},0\\right)\\right)\\right)\\right)\\right)\\) PROCESS SPLIT (11) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = {\\boldsymbol{D}}\\left(\\psi^{n-1},\\frac { {\\boldsymbol{T}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{S}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{R}}\\left( {\\boldsymbol{M}}\\left(\\psi^{n-1}\\right)\\right)\\right)\\right) - \\psi^{n-1}} {2\\Delta t}\\right)\\) The labels Time Split and Process Split refer to the coupling of the dynamical core with the complete parameterization suite. The components within the parameterization suite are coupled via time splitting in both forms. The Process Split form is convenient for spectral transform models. With Time Split approximations extra spectral transforms are required to convert the updated momentum variables provided by the parameterizations to vorticity and divergence for the Eulerian spectral core, or to recalculate the temperature gradient for the semi-Lagrangian spectral core. The Time Split form is convenient for the finite-volume core which adopts a Lagrangian vertical coordinate. Since the scheme is explicit and restricted to small time-steps by its non-advective component, it sub-steps the dynamics multiple times during a longer parameterization time step. With Process Split approximations the forcing terms must be interpolated to an evolving Lagrangian vertical coordinate every sub-step of the dynamical core. Besides the expense involved, it is not completely obvious how to interpolate the parameterized forcing, which can have a vertical grid scale component arising from vertical grid scale clouds, to a different vertical grid.

Horizontal discretization Spectral-element dynamical core TBC Dyanmical core clipping? In E3SM, clipping was mentioned in clubb_intr.F90 An example of an inconsistency in CAM physics is that surface pressure is held fixed during physical parameterization updates, but water vapor, and hence surface pressure, does change during evaporation/precipitation and an inconsistency appears in the mass and energy budget. Similarly, if a \u201c clipper \u201d is used on water vapor or condensates to avoid (unphysical) negative mixing ratios (more details in section 3.2) and this is not accounted for in the thermodynamics or through a surface flux, that \u201c clipping \u201d will produce an energy source via the mass weightening in the TE vertical integral. In the dynamical core TE is not conserved locally in each column as there is a horizontal flux of energy between columns; but the local energy budget should, ideally, be closed and thereby, globally, TE should be conserved. If a dynamical core does not inherently conserve dry air mass and/or water mass then a spurious source of TE is inevitable again through the mass weightening in the vertical integral (unless fixers are applied).

Using a proportional rate of change allows the dilution to reflect the properties of the volume being diluted, in addition to the intensity of the process responsible for the dilution (i.e., entrainment). see Zhang et al. 2021 CAPE-based triggers are commonly used in deep convection schemes such as the ZM scheme, which is one of the common deep convection schemes used in several climate models including the NCAR CAM and the Department of Energy E3SM Atmosphere Model (EAM). undiluted CAPE is defined as the vertical integral of the local buoyancy of a parcel from the launch level to the equilibrium level. By construction, the undilute CAPE trigger scheme prevents the accumulation of instability in the atmosphere beyond the threshold value and results in generally triggering convection too frequently and too early during the day (e.g., Xie & Zhang, 2000).

Difference of CAM5 results from that of CAM4 larger latent heat flux at the surface (worse) deeper and drier boundary layer in CAM5. near-surface relative humidity differs by about 5%, increasing evaporation from the surface. smaller net longwave flux at the surface (improved) due to the difference in the predawn minimum maximum differences are shown in the area with the maximum cloud fraction differences seems to be caused by different cloud radiative properties (e.g., aerosol effect) differences are about 10 W m -2 in the clear-sky portion stronger diurnal cycle in cloud fraction and LWP (overestimate). CAM4:sedimentation is largest sink, convtective turbulence has smaller role daytime: upper cloud: detrainment from shallow convection moisten -> maintain the cloud deck lower cloud: sink due to evaporation CAM5: nighttime: condensation & cloud top radiative cooling dominates the turbulent mixing. daytime: PBL decoupled, only shallow convective detrainment supply water to the cloud layer different precipitation origin CAM4: stratiform process CAM5: shallow convective precipitation. sedimentation of cloud droplets is incorporated into the microphysics term grid-scale condensation and evaporation are contained by a revised macrophysics package.

Higher vertical resolution causes: much stronger temperature & moisture gradient in the boundary layer. allow more variation in layer stability, RH, and buoyancy (i.e., updraft plumes may penetrate more layers before reaching their level of neutral buoyancy [LNB]) drier free troposphere: because water vapor is confined to the boundary layer, in the absence of processes that mix air to higher altitudes shallower convection due to the stronger gradients (and a drier free troposhere) influencing many meteorological features (radiative heating, altitude of detraining heat, and water substances) and the moisture modes that play a significant role in equatorial wave variability. LNB (level of neutral buoyancy) calculation (or cloud top calculation) (Xie et al. 2018): resolution dependent depend strongly on the environment air properties entrained in the updraft (Neal et al. 2008) convection top is sensitive to free troposphere humidity. EAMv1 reduce the resolution dependence by terminating the CAPE calculation when the parcel encounters a single negatively buoyant layer in the plume buoyancy calculation . optional parameterization of convective gustiness: designed to represent the increase in surface wind produced in the presence of evaporating precipitation (Harrop et al., 2018) convective cloud fraction is assumed proportional to the log of the updraft mass flux (Hack et al., 1993) detraining convective condensate in partitioned into liquid and ice liquid size: inherits the stratiform cloud at the same location ice size: specified as a tunable parameter tunable parameters: timescale for calculating closure designed to reduce CAPE (essential to determine cloud base mass) timescale for conversion to precipitation (essential to generate updraft condensate mass via a saturation adjustment) downdraft coefficient: used to control the mass flux at the downdraft top and the evaporation rate of the rainfall driving the downdraft. temperature range that partitioning liquid and ice during the detrainment process due to convective updraft the lowest possible launch level (maybe buoyancy??): from surface to 100 m entrainment parameter(dmpdx): when this is reduced, depth of the convection is controlled. size of the cloud ice formed from detrainment of convective condensate Aerosol Four-mode version of the Modal Aerosol Module (MAM4; Liu et al., 2016): 1 coarse, 3 fine-particle moajor aerosol speies: sulfate, black carbon, primary organic matter, marine organic aerosol (MOA), secondary organic aerosol (SOA), mineral dust, and sea spray new representation of MOA (Burrows et al., 2014; Burrows et al., 2018) -> important step towards linking ocean BGC process with the ocean surface chemistry that determines sea spray aerosol formation. revise the simplified treatment of SOA (single-lumped-species treatment of SOA) --> by adapting SOA production sources (Shrivastava et al., 2015) explicit treatment of multigenerational gas-pase chemistry of SOA precursor gases and particle-phase transformation of SOA.

CLUBB\u00b4s turbulent kinetic energy (and corresponding cloud updraft velocities) does not currently depend directly on radiative cooling rates near cloud top and often produce weak estimated subgrid vertical velocities so a (tunable) lower limit of 0.2 m/s was chosen for the subgrid velocity used to activate liquid and ice clouds. the lower bound for IN calculation is triggered very frequently (impact is small with 0.3 W/m 2 changes in global annual mean longwave and shortwave cloud radiative effects) liquid cloud drop activation: Abdul-Razzak and Ghan (2000). ice nucleation parameterization for heterogeneous ice formation in mixed-phase cloud (Wang et al., 2014) classic nucleation theory(CNT)-based ice nucleation parameterization depends on interstitial and cloud-borne BC & dust aerosol Thresuhold size for autoconversion of ice crystals to snow particles: constant --> function of temperature Autoconversion parameterization: Khairoutdinov and Kogan (2000) represent self-collection of small liquid drops to form precipitataion size particles the tree parameters developed for that parameterization (and usually treated as fixed inviolate constants) are actually subjected to significant uncertainty depending upon cloud regime (Wood, 2005; Kogan, 2013) and have a very strong impact on aerosol indirect radiative effect( e.g., Wang et al., 2012). these values are mostly fitted using a central values for autoconversion (and accretion) choose the values that reduce radiative biases in regions with low cloud water and droplet number in the regimes other than stratocumulus regions (e.g., trade cumuli) produce less precipitation through autoconversion than the standard KK@000 treatment and are very consistent with Kogan (2013) and Beheng (1994) rates in low aerosol (cloud droplet) regimes.

Aerosol mass and number concentrations are merged with a historic inventory of volcanic aerosols wwith an assumed mean radius in the stratosphere. Aerosol optical properties for each aerosol mode (Ghan and Zaveri, 2007) are calculated after merging with historic inventory. optical properties of aerosols are combined using a \"homogeneous mixing assumption\" by volume to produce estimates of single scattering albedo, extinction, and backscatter by wavelength and then provided to the radiative transfer parameterization. Chemistry stratosperic ozone concentration: Hsu and Prather (2009, LINOZ2) Linearized production and loss coefficients characterizing sensitivity to local ozone concentration, local temperature, and the ozone column above are used to calculate stratospheric production loss terms for ozone for each decade of the 1850-2000 time period between 12 and 58 km monthly mean zonal estimates Cariolle et al. (1990): a simple parameterization for ozone depletion in the presence of polar stratospheric clouds at cold temperatures in the stratosphere. the rate of exponential decay is a function of the prescribed chlorine loading (ozone holes will only form when chlorine loading is high, and the temperature is cold enough to form polar stratospheric clouds) advected stratospheric ozone mixing ratios are then merged at the tropopause with prescribed monthly mean tropospheric ozone archived from more comprehensive chemical simulations performed with the MOZART chemical transport model as discussed in Neale et al (2010). this merged ozone distribution is then used in the radiative transfer calculation and for oxidation of aerosol precursors. Chlorine loading: changeable advected by dynamics part.

(2010) maximum vertical overlap is assumed within each of the three regimes representing low (p>700 hPa), middle (400 hPa < p < 700 hPa), and high (p < 400 hPa) clouds. random vertical overlap is assumed between these three regimes liquid cloud drop optic: Wiscombe (1996) ice cloud optics: Mitchell (2002): extended to allow for radiatively active falling snow. process for cloud A subcolumn decomposition of cloud overlap and fraction generates a set of subcolumns in which cloud is either 1 or 0 in each layer. these composited cloud and aerosol properties for each subcolumn are in turn passed to RRTMG along with concentrations of radiatively active gases. the MonteCarlo Independent Column Approximation (Pincus, Baker & Morcrette, 2003) that represents subgrid-scale cloud variability is used to calculate the heating rates and fluxes in each subcolumn for specific spectral bands; averaging each subcolumn\u00b4s radiative heating rate over time and subcolumn provides an estimate o f grid mean radiative heating rate.

Isotropic orographic source is assumed (wave amplitudes are independent of source-layer wind direction, but orographic GW wave orientations are assumed to be normal to the source-layer wind. near-surface flow nonlinearities arising from flow splitting (blocking) of downslope winds is not represented (e.g., Lott & Miller, 1997; Scinocca & McFarlane, 2004) convective (Beres et al. 2004) produced by oscillating convectivee motion with the deep convective cells launched when deep convection procuded by the ZM parameterization width and shape: a function of phase speed determined by the depth of deep convective heating (from heating profile from the ZM parameterization) amplitude: the square of the max heating in ZM scaled by a factor obstacle effect is not considered responsible for producing QBO-like fluctuation of the equatorial zonal wind , but the amplitude and period were not optimized in the current EAM and the oscillation is currently too strong frontal (Charron & Manzini, 2002) produced when the frontogenesis function (by Hoskins, 1982) is found to exceed a specified threshold at 600 hPa lanched at 500 hPa with a prespecified momentum flux amplitude. spectrum is alligned parallel to the wind at the source level (the steering level of fronts) 40 individual waves with phase speeds from U -100 to U +100 m/s are launched The spectrum is Gaussian in shape and centered on the source level wind. critical in reversing high-latitude upper-stratospheric and mesospheric jets and are ultimately responsible for producing the mesopause temperature reversal in models. the top boundary condition for GW is set so the momentum flux goes out at the model top important in the momentum budget above 40 km in the Northern Hemisphere and above 50 km in the Southern Hemisphere .

IWP simulated by EAMv1L (11.64 g m -2 ) is significantly smaller than that produced by EAMv0 (31.70 g m -2 ) due to change of the ice-to-snow autoconversion scheme . substantially weaker LWCF over the TWP due to less high cloud cover. Precipitation excessive precipiation over large portions of the tropic, Arabian Sea, Pacific ITCZ, the subtropical oceans, Nortwestern Indian Ocean and Africa. less precipitation over Amazon, TWP, and South China Sea. (mostly due to tuning) Temperature & Moisture cold biases in the upper troposphere in the tropical and subtropical regions moistures are trapped in the lower levels, drier mid/upper troposphere. Impact of tuning parameter \"capeten\" and Air Parcel Launch Level in ZM capeten: the number of negative buoyancy layers that deep convection can penetrate. adjustment leads to: overall: negative on high clouds & tropical precipitation increase in low clouds in the Sc/Cu transition region decrease of low clouds along the equatorial deep convection region (reduction up to 15%) tropical convection is substantially suppressed over the TWP & Eastern Pacific warm pool off the central Americal coast (reduced high cloud & LWCF) enhanced precipitation and high clod over tropical lands & adjacent oceans (increase in LWCF) significant cloud reduction above 6 km is due to the higher cloud launch level. Summary Overall improvement in comparison with EAMv0 1) cloud products - increased stratocumulus (except near the coasts) and trade-wind cumulus - better transition from Sc to Cu 2) reduced biases in LWCF, especially over tropical land and adjacent ocean 3) notably improved precipitation over the oceans adjacent to the indian peninsula and tropical eastern Indian ocean. remaining problems due to CLUBB, MG2: dry biases over the Amazon region substantial reduction of Sc off the west coast of major continents in the subtropics largely reduced high clouds over TWP lack of low and middle level clouds over deep convection regions dry bias in TWP and South East Asia. CLUBB led to an initial reduction of stratocumulus clouds Impact of increasing vertical resolution large reduction of high cloud over tropical deep convection regimes (weaker LWCF over TWP) excessive precipitation in the tropics increase of Sc off the west coasts of Nort and South America But, tuning parameter leads to an overall increase of high clouds and reduction of low and middle clouds in the tropical region Impact of increasing horizontal resolution decrease in cloud and precipitation field (weaker SWCF and LWCF) in the tropical and subtropical regions stronger precipitation in ITCZ But, tuning parameter leads to improve clouds and precipitation, including notable increase of Sc.

Inconsistent relationship between surface moisture and latent heat fluxes (LHFLX) the vertical fluxes of moisture, latent heat, and senstible heat across the Earth\u00b4s surface are parameterized using an overly simplified relationship in CLUBB moisture flux: caused by processes like evapotranspiration, fusion, and/or sublimation at the surface latent heat flux: the energy exchange associated with such phase change. moisture flux is derived from the latent heat flux by assuming a constant scaling factor between the two, namely the latent heat of evaporation, and ignoring the distinction from sublimation. conservation errors are removed by using the coupler-provided moisture and latent heat fluxes. Clipping of downward moisture fluxes at the Earth\u00b4s surface. the downward fluxes could lead to negative humidity in the near-surface layers of the atmospheric model. QNEG4: The subroutine limits the downward surface moisture flux to an amount that would result in zero water vapour in the lowest layer, assuming the downward flux affects only the bottom layer, no moisture source is provided from layers above, a Euler forward method is used for time integration. when moisture flux is limited, a corresponding adjustment is applied to the latent heat flux assuming the clipped amount of downward moisture flux corresponds to evaporation. surface sensible heat flux is adjusted by the same amount (to balance the total energy flux).
