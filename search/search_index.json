PBL becomes more turbulent during CLUBB process, decreasing cloud fraction. Why CLUBB is not as active? enhanced turbulence -> Analysis 1 DEEPCU: Reduction of convection due to radiative heating lead to: increase in Q in the lower part of the atmosphere due to less pumping of air. decrease in Q in the cloud layer due to less 'pumping up the air'. CLUBB: put convection due to radiative heating back. surplus humidity from DEEPCU is added near 850 hPa surplus instability from DEEPCU allow more turbulence especially in trade cumulus region. (colder cloud layer and warmer surface enhances turbulence, moisture flux also increased, increasing buoyancy (not shown) ) skewness increased in trade cumulus region(w\u00b4 3 ) meaning that the clouds in this region is more cumulus-like heat flux is reversed near the cloud top due to downward shift of cloud and increase the stability. possible cause: enhanced turbulence during CLUBB trigger cloud formations in the lower altitude (?), depleting water vapor, hence the clouds near 850 hPa decreases, lowering the cloud top height (?) this effect may change the temperature vertical profile strengthening the surface turbulence consequently decrease the overall cloud fraction more clouds forms in the lower part of the atmosphere due to the excessive Q and buoyancy. but, clouds decrease near the cloud top possibly due to: shallow cumuli triggered in CLUBB formed in the lower altitude, depleting vapor in the lower altitude, reducing the cloud formation near 850 hPa. less Q is pumped up during DEEPCU, reducing the cloud formation near 850 hPa decreased CUDET cloud water decrease the moisture source due to detrainment. ( det simulation) since detrained air from shallow convection is a source of moisture to the upper half of the cloud layer (e.g., Bellenger et al., 2015 ;Riehl et al. 1951 ; Nitta and Esbensen 1974 ), decrease in moisture flux due to decrease in detrainment may decrease the cloud fraction near cloud top. The response is not as active due to high vertical resolution ( Guo et al., 2019 ) Figure 14 next plan check the impact of CUDET CLDLIQ detrainment/entrainment effect on shallow cumulus reduce CUDET CLDLIQ and see if the changes in cloud is almost equilvalant to the 'test' simulation currently, CLUBB does not use detrained mass flux (zdu, du) but use detrained CLDLIQ (dlf). change the location of DEEPCU process (e.g., Donahue and Caldwell, 2018 to make CLUBB trigger shallow cumulus before DEEPCU does --> result find new ways to enhance the detrainment/entrainment effect during CLUBB. Analysis 2 decrease detrainment by 20%. expected result: decrease in CUDET CLDLIQ -> less moisture flux -> overall cloud decreases. expected side effect: decrease in cloud results in less cloud radiative feedback simulation setting: shallow convection detrainment effect is indirectly parameterized in CLUBB (using TKE and buoyancy length scale). deep convection scheme calculate detrainment and only detrained CLDLIQ (dlf) is added in CUDET (detrained mass flux (zdu) is not used in CLUBB). for that reason, I reduce dlf by 20% hoping that the CLUBB indirectly reduce the moisture flux due to shallow convection detrainment. result moisture flux within the boundary layer decreases Magnitude of Q tendency decreases in DEEPCU, and the compensating amount increases in CLUBB overall cloud liquid tendencies decreases in CLUBB process This result indicates that the when the detrainment/entrainment effect cause the formation of cloud in CLUBB process. change DEEPCU location. problems: DEEPCU depletes relatively large amount of water vapor and decrease surface temperature in the trade cumulus region which reduces a lot of instability. Cloud water is diagnosed in CLUBB using saturation adjustment; that is, instantaneous condensation and evaporation within small air parcels (Larson et al., 2012). Therefore, CLUBB is very sensitive to the state variables. For that reason, although it is not physically meaningful, instead of calculating DEEPCU after CLUBB, I setup an experiment as if DEEPCU and CLUBB is happening simultaneously (parallel splitting). put same state variable for DEEPCU and CLUBB01 so CLUBB01 does not affected by the changes due to DEEPCU ptend. result: the new simulation trigger more shallow convection in the first CLUBB substep (almost twice as large as ctrl), but the compensating amount decreases in the second substep in trade cumulus region (this response is not shown in stratocumulus region.) Overall, CLDLIQ did not changed much CLDICE changed (temperature is erroneously applied to CUDET due to code change, triggering ZM ice detrainment) Vertical wind variance and the moisture flux increases and the skewness decreases in the trade cumulus region see turbulence plots it seems to be that the differences between test and ctrl are due to the radiative cooling effect When radiative heat is removed during CLUBB process, CLDLIQ increment differences from ctrl is opposite from the difference between test and ctrl. triggering shallow convection either DEEPCU or CLUBB is not the problem because errors from triggering effect will be compensated during substepping. Although changing the location of DEEPCU process won\u00b4t cause the overall result, substepping DEEPCU will change the result, not because of the numerical problem but because of the time-step sensitivity of DEEPCU what I learn from this simulation CLUBB condensates cloud liquid instantaneously, whereas DEEPCU condensates cloud liquid for a certain time period. For that reason, increasing substeps in MACMIC sub cycle does not affect model results much. Changes in \"STATE\" variable affect the CLUBB\u00b4s behavior. next step dribbling DEEPCU tendency in the MACMIC subcycle subcycle DEEPCU Dribbling DEEPCU tendency in the MACMIC subcycle simulation setting save DEEPCU ptend and update ptend_deepcu/cld_macmic_num_steps in every substep result the response of CLUBB to cloud water in dribbling deep convection tendency in MACMIC subcycle is somewhat similar with test simulation in Peru and Peru trade cumulus region ( see differences ) Clouds are shifted downward. however, CLUBB in dribbleZM simulation not only triggers more shallow convections but also falsely triggers some deep convections. for that reason, state differences in dribbleZM-ctrl are different from test-ctrl. region test - ctrl dribbleZM - ctrl Peru Peru trade result (continue) In the first subcycle of CLUBB, cloud water increments are even larger than ctrl, but the 2~6 subcycles of CLUBB produce less cloud water than ctrl. clouds are formed in the lower altitude in dribbleZM than ctrl. RH is shifted downward This indicates that cloud formation in CLUBB process largely affected by the supersaturation formed by other processes (other than DEEPCU), and DEEPCU in ctrl simulation remove supersaturation prior to CLUBB. Interestingly, eventhough the DEEPCU tendencies are updated evenly in every sub-steps, changes in dribbleZM from ctrl in CLUBB tendency in the first substep is even higher than the rest of the substep Overall, cloud fraction increases in the trade cumulus regions but decrease in the stratocumulus region clouds are shifted downward Sc to Cu transition is much more smoother in dribble ZM than ctrl w\u00b4 2 is higher, w\u00b4 3 is more continuous subcycle DEEPCU with MACMIC result clouds in the stratiform regions are simulated more 'stratus'-like clouds (higher w\u00b4 2 , lower w\u00b4 3 ), increasing cloud water. transition from Sc to Cu is much more smoother than ctrl. shallow convections are triggered more in CLUBB, but the clouds formed by CLUBB appears in the lower level than the one that is triggered by DEEPCU. however, detrained cloud water from DEEPCU decreases, leading to decrease the cloud near 800 hPa in the trade-cumulus region. cloud fraction (Peru cross section) turbulence (Peru cross section) Peru vertical profile Peru-trade vertical profile Analysis3 Bogenschutz et al. (2021): Timestep sensitivity is due to a weakening of tendencies and mass fluxes from the ZM scheme . A reduction of the ZM time scale helps to consume convective available potential energy (CAPE) more efficiently to ameliorate this bias in the tropics (not shown (G. Zhang & McFarlane, 1995),), though the bias in the low cloud regions is very similar. Of course, in E3SM the CLUBB parameterization, MG2 microphysics, and large scale vertical advection in the dynamical core should not have time step limitation since they employ implicit, semi-Lagrangian, and timesplitted sedimentation methods, respectively. Unfortunately, our ultra-high vertical resolution 16XL simulation provides inconclusive results on this matter as that simulation required extreme time step adjustments to run stably, to which we find E3SM is quite sensitive to the time step. Yang et al. ( 2020 ) remove the CAPE that is consumed by shallow convection from ZM so CLUBB can trigger more shallow convection precipitation did not change much, but the precipitation peak time has changed . The improvements are less evident over ocean than over land mainly due to the weak diurnal variation of the reserved CAPE over ocean because shallow convections are relatively statistically steady there (Brown et al., 2002). Additional hypothesis: Since CLUBB condensates cloud water instantaneously, less 'pumping-up-the-Q' due to weaker DEEPCU however, when the CAPE is low in both DEEPCU and CLUBB, cloud fraction increases ( see plots ). enhanced cloud-top entrainment decrease the clouds enhanced turbulence may enhance entrainment leading to drying the cloud top However, the contribution of entrainment rate is rather small (0.3%) compared to other tunable parameters 3. Shallow cumulus are formed in the lower layer When DEEPCU ls less active, turbulence within the boundary layer increases during CLUBB process colder near cloud bottom, warmer near surface turbulence within the boundary layer become more turbulent, but the cloud top become more stable. DYNEND & CLUBB wind speed tendencies are pairing. For that reason, less Q is transported near 850 hPa. more cloud water is precipitated out due to higher turbulence (see Water <--> Precip tendency ) cloud water fall speed increases ({==why??=} fall speed is a function of droplet size) rain evaporates more in test simulation near surface. one of the drawbacks of CLUBB-MG coupling (The configurations used by Bogenschutz et al. (2013), Guo et al. (2014), and Guo et al. (2015)) is that MG microphysics is designed to parameterize stratiform cloud and whose assumptions about subgrid variability may not be well-suited to cumulus clouds . also, a different marginal PDF shape of cloud water is assumed by CLUBB in order to diagnose cloud liquid water content (namely, a truncated normal mixture) than is assumed by the microphysics in order to compute autoconversion and accretion (namely, a gamma function) (Morrison and Gettelman, 2008). Hohenegger and Bretherton (2011) stated that \u201cthe main difference between shallow and deep convection is precipitation (both rain and snow) and its effects\u201c. Thayer-Calder et al. ( 2015 ) mentioned that replacing ZM-CLUBB with CLUBB-SILHS will replace many of these problems higher stability near cloud top less turbulence, less buoyancy, adn near the cloud top PBL height decreases (?; not sure about this mechanism..) --> need to check plot temperature near PBL height shift downward. available CAPE trigger more of shallow convection in CLUBB process, but shallow cumulus are formed in the lower layer, depleting humidity in the lower layer shallow convections are often triggered in the lower level then deep convection (Lu et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2015) these effects has diurnal cycle (because CAPE increase during daytime) Overall, the interplay between physics and dynamics seems to be more effective (?) nudging simulation need to be done. check point: did CLUBB really trigger more shallow convection?: CLDLIQ in CLUBB substeps: in Peru stratocumulus: 4.87e-06 kg kg -1 of cloud water increases in the lower altitude and 8.94e-06 kg kg -1 cloud water decreased compared to ctrlin the original cloud layer. in Peru trade: 1.41e-05 kg kg -1 of cloud water formed and 2.98e-06 kg kg -1 of cloud water decreased compared to ctrl in the original cloud layer. plot link turbulence: turbulence within the PBL increased in the trade cumulus region. Cloud top instability decreases because cloud bottom is colder. overall Q & RH changes 4. positive feedback between PBL cloud-SST available CAPE heat up the lower atmosphere enhances a well-known positive feedback between subtropical boundary layer clouds and the SST, where a negative bias in cloud cover and cloud water leads to warmer surface waters (due to increased short- wave radiation at the ocean surface) that, in turn, lead to even less clouds (e.g., Philander et al. 1996; Ma et al. 1996; Park et al. 2005; Teixeira et al. 2008) Zhang et al. ( 2018 ) shows that enhanced shallow convection (+4 K SST perturbation simulation) generally dries the PBL, and stronger shallow convection in the present climate would then imply more drying and larger reduction in LCC (convective drying, mostly stratocumulus regions). Brient et al. (2015) and M. Zhang et al. (2013) found that strengthened shallow convection in a warmer climate leads to drying of the PBL by transporting moisture to the free troposphere (convective drying) when shallow convection dominates turbulent mixing, suggesting a positive cloud feedback (decreased low cloud cover, LCC). The strength of convective drying has been found to be related to model-specific convection parameterizations (Vial et al., 2016). As the climate warms, large-scale and small-scale lower-tropospheric mixings have been found to deplete the layers of water vapor needed to sustain low clouds in a similar way, and lower-tropospheric mixing in the present climate has been further proposed to provide a good observational constraint on ECS among GCMs (Sherwood et al., 2014). Brient et al. (2015) point outs that boundary-layer turbulence (causing negative cloud feedback) and shallow convection (causing positive cloud feedback) can act simultaneously, and their relative strength controls the sign and intensity of low-cloud feedbacks in models. Indeed, the strength of low-cloud feedbacks in individual climate models can be changed substantially by manipulating either convection schemes (e.g., Gettelman et al. 2012; Tomassini et al. 2014) or turbulence schemes (Watanabe et al. 2012). in this paper, reduced boundary-layer turbulence lower the cloud altitude intensified shallow convection decrease the cloud fraction. Signs of convective drying: stronger shallow convection (higher skewness) can transport more moisture from the PBL to the free troposphere (higher RH in the above and below the cloud layer) and thus contribute to the cloud fraction decrease, usually with the deepening of PBL clouds (convective drying) (see Oct. 1~9th turbulence plot below ) state Q differences shows that the moisture is transported to the free troposphere strong shallow convection case near surface cloud layer w\u00b4 2 \u2191 (more turbulent) \u2193 (more upward motion due to enhanced shallow convection skewness - \u2191 (more convective) buoyancy \u2191 \u2191 moisture flux \u2191 cloud bottom \u2191 (moisture source from the sfc), cloud top \u2193 (detrain/entrainment, moistening FT) RH \u2191 (moistend due to turbulence) \u2193 (convective drying) cloud fraction - decrease when the cloud fraction decrease -> shallow convection weakens Oct. 1~9 Peru trade cloud Oct. 1~9 Peru trade turbulence Oct. 20~29 Peru trade cloud Oct. 20~29 Peru trade turbulence when the radiative heating effect is removed during CLUBB process (noclubbrad simulation), cloud fraction increases. Cause of the diurnal cycle radiative heating effect increase CAPE during nighttime and reduce CAPE during daytime over stratocumulus region. for that reason, in the beginning of the calculation, CAPE tendency of CLUBB in Peru trade cumulus region is higher in test than ctrl during daytime starting from the third day of the calculation, CLUBB in test simulation starts to consume more CAPE However, during the adjustment period, test simulation produce less cloud, resulting weaker radiative cooling effect. during the daytime, relative humidity is lower in the cloud layer in the test simulation, resulting in less cloud. possible cause: less Q pumped up to provide more humidity in the cloud layer more Q is consumed to form clouds that were supposed to be consumed during DEEPCU. Enhanced PBL turbulence dry the PBL by transporting mositure to the free troposphere Brient et al. (2015) and M. Zhang et al. (2013) found that strengthened shallow convection in a warmer climate leads to drying of the PBL by transporting moisture to the free troposphere (convective drying) when shallow convection dominates turbulent mixing, suggesting a positive cloud feedback (decreased low cloud cover, LCC). cloud-radiation feedback (less cloud ->less radiative heating effect -> less cloud) reduces more cloud. the results in test simulation are unstable. when we look at the variable tendencies by checkpoint in the first 3 days of the calculation, CAPE in DEEPCU process start to change Oct. 1~3 Peru trade Q CLDLIQ T Relative humidity Wind field Beljaars et al.

In E3SM model, two different schemes that parameterize convective clouds are implemented: Zhang\u2013McFarlane scheme for deep convection and CLUBB for shallow convection. add add add add add add CLUBB has been shown to improve the simulation of clouds, particulary in the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition (Bogenschutz et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2018). E3SM generates low-level stratocumulus clouds for slightly lower LTS values than ERA-Interim. E3SM results are compared with satellite using COSP simulator for the apple-to-apple model and satellite comparison. In the previous study of Zhang et al. (2019), E3SM underestimates optically thin (0.3 < \\(\\tau\\) < 3.6; catagorized as cumulus cloud in ISCCP cloud type) low cloud fraction (z < 3 km) and mostly overestimate optically intermediate clouds (3.6 \\(\\tau\\) < 23; categorized as stratocumulus in ISCCP cloud types) compared to MISR. Optically intermediate clouds near the coastal eastern Pacific are underestimated in E3SM, and the possible reasons are the area of low vertical velocity skewness assumed for Sc in CLUBB is too narrow and the annual mean skewness is too high ( Qian et al. 2018 ), especially 'gamma' (Constant of the width of PDF in w coordinate) and 'c8' (constant associated with Newtonian damping of w\u00b43) these terms are tuned in this way because of the Net energy balance at the top of the atmosphere (Xie et al., 2018). E3SM is also compared with CALIPSO data. CALIPSO data are only available between 80\u02daS and 80\u02daN. Low-level clouds are underestimated in the stratocumulus (Sc) to cumulus (Cu) cloud regime. Bogenschutz et al ( 2021 ) also found that E3SM tends to produce too little cloud fraction compared to the C3M (Kato et al., 2010) satellite observations, but produces a peak cloud liquid water amount that is fairly comparable to observations. Thus, the radiational biases in the CNTL experiment appear to stem from Sc clouds that are simulated to be too few in amount. For the better understanding of Sc to Cu regime, cross sections of two regions are selected. Peru: -5\u02daN, 120\u02daW to -5\u02daS, 80\u02daW (currently select the region by my self, could be changed if I find a more appropriate place) California: 35\u02daN, 125\u02daW to 1\u02daS, 173\u02daW (followed the GPCI cross section) In both region, low-level clouds are shallower, and the cloud base heights are higher than CALIPSO Peru E3SM vs CALIPSO California E3SM vs CALIPSO Near the Sc to Cu transition region, PBL (gray line) is separamted from the cloud bottom. buoyancy flux (w\u00b4 \\(\\theta_{vp}\\) ) and the skewness term (w\u00b4 3 ) has two layer. w\u00b4 3 term in stratocumulus region is too positively skewed (negative or small w\u00b4 3 is expected in the stratocumulus region (Larson, 2019, in CLUBB document paper) similar error have been found in Bogenschutz et al ( 2021 ) in Bogenschutz et al. (2021), since CLUBB is a function of the vertical velocity skewness (Golaz et al., 2002), the near zero values of vertical velocity skewness parameterized by high vertical resolution simulation within the cloud will directly result in more cloud fraction and cloud liquid compared to the positive values simulated in the lower resolution counterparts. Major cloud water sink is found near the cloud bottom. Peru turbulence in CLUBB California turbulence in CLUBB Peru variable tendencies by checkpoint California variable tendencies by checkpoint clouds in Sc to Cu regime has strong diurnal variation, and the major cloud water sink occurs during daytime results are 2009 Oct data. Data are hourly average Peru diurnal cycle Peru trade diurnal cycle California diurnal cycle Hypothesis possible reasons for small low-level cloud water drier boundary layer: Compared to ERA5 data (only 2009 Oct data), E3SM has higher humidity, therefore this would not be the case: Figure cloud layer temperature is lower in E3SM than ERA5 (due to less condensation?). too strong cloud layer updraft: enhanced turbulence due to radiative cooling Guo et al. (2019) show that the cloud radiative effect intensifies the cloud formation, drying the surface (vertical resolution dependent results). model itself simulate strong updraft shallow convection is triggered in the deep convection scheme. shallow convection is triggered in the height that has the maximum entrainment rate. Deep convection scheme is designed mainly for deep convection, so triggering shallow convection is not realistic. CLUBB is designed to trigger shallow convection implicitly. But CUDET_CLDLIQ > CLUBB_CLDLIQ, and these are triggered at certain level, note: in the plots that I\u00b4ve been drawing, it looks like there are two layer, but when I look at the cross section plot, the two cloud layer is due to the overlapping two region selection (stratocumulus&trade cumulus). CLUBB condences detrained water from DEEPCU vigorously. decoupling: during daytime, solar radiation absorption>cloud top LW cooling warmer air entrained cloud layer is slightly warmer than the sub-cloud layer slightly thin stable layer below cloud (Sandu et al., 2008) --> buoyancy near cloud layer decreases( see turbulence term above ) moisture supplies are cut-offed. In stratocumulus regimes heat and moisture fluxes of warm and moist air are strongest at night (see plot ) buoyancy term is decoupled in the morning signs of decoupling seems to be not as strong. In trade cumulus regimes most trade cumulus simulated in E3SM forms above 850 hPa. PBL heights are lower than that. heat flux gradient and the moisture flux gradient reaches below cloud base, within the PBL. maybe ambient water below cloud base are depleted due to DEEPCU process new simulation -> this is not numerical problem skip this if cloud radiative feedback effect is removed during CLUBB, will cloud formed in the lower layer? can we expect less decoupling and less cloud breaking? if the water depletion due to DEEPCU is removed, how the CLUBB would react? change DEEPCU location. original: DEEPCU -> CLUBB01 change: CLUBB01 -> DEEPCU -> CLUBB02 ... implement new entrainment scheme. Gamache and Houze (1983) estimate that as much as 60% to 75% of the condensate in the stratiform portion of the convective system comes from detrainment of hydrometeors from the convective updrafts. ZM scheme does not allow detraining below \\(\\lambda_0\\) . but shallow cumulus occors below that level ( Lu et al., 2012 ; Guo et al., 2015 ) may trigger more clouds to form during CLUBB due to detrained water during DEEPCU decrease efficiency for penetrative entrainment. enhance updraft in the shallow cumulus layer (?) to trigger more shallow cumulus than in the deep convection. Cloud radiative feedback effect. 2022.03.15 cloud radiative feedback nighttime: LW cooling at cloud top intensifies the BL instability daytime: absorption of SW is greater than LW cooling, increase stability, reduces RH, evaporates clouds (detrain). purpose to see if the cause of the cloud water sink near cloud base is too strong cloud layer updraft due to strong cloud radiative feedback decoupling due too strong cloud radiative feedback. Note Decoupling can be caused either by reducing the intensity of radiatively driven circulation in relation to STBL depth or by stabilizing the subcloud layer (Zheng et al., 2018b). The first possibility might be realized with daytime shortwave radiative heating which offsets longwave cooling (Nicholls, 1984; Turton and Nicholls, 1987) or by extensive entrainment of warm and dry free-tropospheric air which deepens the STBL to such an extent that the turbulence is no longer sufficient to sustain the mixing (Bretherton and Wyant, 1997). The second possibility involves stratification of the lower part by cooling, for instance, due to precipitation evaporation (Caldwell et al., 2005; Dodson and Small Griswold, 2021) or advection over colder sea surface (Stevens et al., 1998). hypothesis: if the radiative heating effect is reduced stratocumulus: less cloud, but more clouds in the altitude of cloud base due to weakend turbulence. trade cumulus: nighttime: similar with stratocumulus daytime: more cloud cloud fraction due to less cloud breakup (less decoupling). checkpoint: PBL height during daytime, turbulence, buoyancy simulation setting basic setting: same as ctrl setting in Radheat simulation ctrl: same as \"Radheat simulation\" ( radheat_cpl_opt = 0 ) noclubbrad: radiation heat is subtracted before CLUBB, and added back after CLDMIC ( radheat_cpl_opt = 4 ) no radiative heating during CLUBB process low-level cloud fraction stratocumulus region cloud formation weakens clouds are shifted to lower altitude due to weakened turbulence. trade-cumulus region cloud fraction increases clouds are formed in lower altitudes in noclubbrad simulation than ctrl. CLUBB turbulence decrease in heat flux gradient is larger over trade cumulus region, leading to less moisture flux. overall turbulence decreases (w \u00b42 term) less cloud break up skewness near Sc to Cu transition increases buoyancy flux also decrease in the trade cumulus region, and the separation of buoyancy flux is reduced. We can expect that the decoupling effect had been reduced in this region. not much of a difference in PBL height Peru turbulence California not available yet.... running simulation. vertical profile by checkpoint Globally, cloud fraction increases in trade cumulus region, cloud water decreases, but cloud fraction increases. evidence of less stratocumulus evidence of less cloud breaking need to check diurnal cycle other possibility: DEEPCU triggers more shallow convection. -> seems to be not the case when the radiative heating is removed in DEEPCU (test3 sim.), cloud fraction shifted to higher altitude in trade cumulus region and lower altitude in stratocumulus region compared to ctrl whereas the overall cloud fraction increases when the radiative heating is removed only in CLUBB (noclubbrad) when the radiative heating is removed both in DEEPCU and CLUBB, the results are similar with noclubbrad simulation. no radiative heating effect in CLUBB no radiative heating effect in DEEPCU no radiative heating effect both in DEEPCU and CLUBB Global California Peru Peru trade Australia Namibian next step check diurnal cycle to see if the cloud breaking had been really decrease Diurnal cycle diurnal turbulence plot ( note: to see the 'cloud breakup', cloud mask option in the plot is turned off ) overall decrease in turbulence, but increase in cloud fraction due to less cloud breaking. daytime nighttime w\u00b4 2 increase near cloud layer decrease heat flux less warming less cooling moisture flux ??? less suppliment of vapor due to weakened turbulence buoyancy increase decrease cloud fraction increases due to less cloud breakup (cannot separate the effect of increase due to long-lasting cloud effect and decrease due to less formation of cloud) decrease California Peru Peru trade Australia Namibian next step LWP comparison with observation. try removing radheat from both DEEPCU and CLUBB (to see if the response shown in removing radiative heat in CLUBB is due to enhanced DEEPCU or not) (done) time step sensitivity: if radiation scheme is calculated iteratively with MACMIC, will decoupling effect reduced and increase the overall cloud fraction? Xiao et al. ( 2014 ) show that reducing horizontal radiative heating variability decrease cloud fraction, causing rapid transition from Sc to Cu. However, Bogenschutz et al (2021) examined the turbulence profiles from various time step setting experiments and found no evidence that the time steps produce any significant changes in the behavior of the simulated turbulence (not shown). --> different from this case because they only reduce MACMIC timestep. Also, Lee et al. ( 2021 ) found that decreasing time step in CLUBB and microphysics in high vertical resolution similation does not appear to substantially affect the long-term climate trend nor the climatological stratocumulus results. Wan et al. (2021) also found that the radiation scheme is not so sensitive to the time step change. first step: check turbulence in the simulation with the different time step. https://confluence.pnnl.gov/confluence/display/CMDVSE/SciDAC+simulation subcycle radiation scheme with MACMIC simulation subrad: subcycle radiation scheme with MACMIC (only ptend of the radiation scheme is subcycled) sybcycZM: subcycle DEEPCU scheme with MACMIC subradZM: subcycle radiation scheme and DEEPCU scheme with MACMIC (subrad - ctrl) & (subradZM - subcycZM) : effect of subcycling radiation scheme result overall, cloud fraction increases in Sc to CU regions when the radiation scheme is subcycled with MACMIC (and the response to the turbulence terms are somewhat similar to that of noclubbrad). However, more convective clouds are triggered in the trade cumulus region. when the DEEPCU is also subcycled, turbulence in the stratocumulus region increases (see 15S in Peruvian region cloud fraction increases in subradZM simulation, but the response due to subcycling radiation scheme is different from subrad. Higher temporal resolution for radiation scheme do increase the cloud fraction, but not particularly increase the clouds near cloud base. cloud fraction (subrad - ctrl) cloud fraction (subradZM - subcycZM) Peruvian cross section (radsub-ctrl) Peruvian cross section (subradZM - subcycZM) diurnal cycle California Peru Peru trade Australia Namibian RH related E3SM\u00b4s cloud fraction in Sc to Cu transition region is smaller than the satellite Relative humidity within the boundary layer is larger, but smaller in the cloud layer compared to ERA5 (figure is for JJA) this deviation becomes even larger in the simulation with smaller timestep (figure is for JJA). possible reason thinner PBL height Less detrained air from shallow convection (?): cloud freeze dry?? other problems related to RH RHcrit = 0.95 in current setting However, convective clouds have large subgrid variability.

(2021) showed that the E3SM is more sensitive to time step when the micro/macro cloud physics is sub cycled together. Wan et al. (2021) also mentioned that increasing the subcycling frequency causes the cooling, drying, and cloud fraction decrease in the tropical middle and upper troposphere and mostly high-cloud fractions. Pronounced problems are shown mostly in high clouds (Wan et al., 2021). This is a conflicting result from Santos et al. (2021), but the difference in integration period may cause this problem due to high seasonality in cloud fraction. in Santos et al. (2021), high cloud increases in All_Shorter and All_Except_MacMic_Shorter simulation, but decrease in MacMic_shorter simulation. in Wan et al. (2021), high cloud decreases in All_Shorter and MacMic_shorter simulation, but increase in high latitude in All_Except_MacMic_Shorter simulation. time step sensitivity due to MAC-MIC is expected to be due to the microphysics. however, coupling between MAC-MIC seems to contributes large portion of cloud fraction decrease over stratocumulus regions (see green boxes in macmic36-cldmic36) macmic36-ctrl macmic36-cldmic36 nosub-ctrl simulation setting in cam namelist clubb_timestep: timestep for clubb (automatically changes only when clubb_timestep > dtime) cld_macmic_num_steps: number of clubb steps within the subcycling loop micro_mg_num_steps: number of microphysics steps within the subcycling loop name dtime MAC-MIC subcycle together clubb_timestep microphysics timestep etc ctrl 1800 s 6 300 s 300 s noclubbsub 1800 s 1 1800 s 1800 s nosub 300 s 1 300 s 300 s macmic36 1800 s 36 60 s 60 s mac6mic6 1800 s 6 60 s 60 s clubb and microphysics runs 36 times, but only subcycled together 6 times clubb36 1800 s 6 60 s 300 s cldmic36 1800 s 6 300 s 60 s note in Bogenschutz et al. (2012) , CLUBB requires a time step less than 300 s (the reason was not explained in this paper). Results Global result difference between ctrl and macmic36 seems to be mostly due to MAC-MIC coupling. Q decrease near 850 hPa or above between 30\u02daS to 30\u02daN seems to be due to cldmic36 and MAC-MIC coupling. However, these differences are not only confined to stratocumulus region, but to almost the entire area between 30\u02daS to 30\u02daN ( see plot ). process that affect low latitude Q is mostly dynamics and CLUBB. T decrease seems to be mostly due to MAC-MIC coupling. low-level cloud fraction decrease is the combination of cldmic36 and MAC-MIC coupling. high-level cloud fraction decrease is the combination of clubb36 and MAC-MIC coupling. reducing CLUBB and CLDMIC timestep and coupling MAC-MIC frequency increases cloud fraction especially over stratocumulus regions (why?) Q near 850 hPa also increases (why?) this difference is even larger than the coupling outside of the MAC-MIC ( nosub - ctrl ) zonal ctrl vs. macmic36 ctrl vs. clubb36 ctrl vs. cldmic36 mac6mic6 vs. ctrl macmic36 vs. cldmic36 macmic36 vs. mac6mic6 (need to update later! this is not an annual average) horizontal ctrl vs. macmic36 ctrl vs. clubb36 ctrl vs. cldmic36 macmic36 vs. cldmic36 mac6mic6 vs. ctrl macmic36 vs. mac6mic6 Global average cloud water tendency is the largest in macmic36 and water to precipitation conversion is also the largest. when the CLUBB time step is shorter, the rate of the 'cloud water to precipitation' conversion becomes larger, leaving less cloud water in the air. when the microphysics time step is shorter, less cloud water is converted to precipitation, leaving more cloud water in the air. in the toy model, more cloud water is converted to precipitation when the microphysics time step is shorter. however, in MACMIC36 , 15% of the cloud water remain in the atmosphere, but the cloud fraction is smaller. cloud fraction decrease but cloud water increase? low-level cloud fraction macmic36 has the smallest value, but mac6mic6 has the largest value. cloud water to precipitation conversion decreases in cldmic36 and mac6mic6 simulation, but increase in macmic36 cloud water tendency increases in clubb36 and macmic36 (solved) more cloud water formed when CLUBB is subcycled more frequently, but the total cloud water is higher in CLDMIC36 than CLUBB36 in the zonal average plot, low-level cloud fraction and low-level cloud water decrease in the zonal average plot, high-level cloud fraction and low-level cloud water decrease no cloud evaporation in microphysics scheme.

(2014) mentioned that, for the long time steps commonly employed by GCMs can deplete all the cloud water and condense more cloud water at the next time step, resulting in an oscillation between cloud and no cloud states. in this study, QCRAT (a limiter) is introduced to avoid cloud water depletion. QCRAT is effective in cold regions with supercooled water. The limiter is effective in lower liquid amounts, and also in the place where the vapor deposition process occurs (depletes water onto ice and snow). smaller microphysics time step may overpredict depletion in E3SM. from the table (vertical integrals are integrated from 680 hPa to 1000 hPa (low-cloud levels by ISCCP)) when the time step is shorter, less cloud water become rain (less sink), but in MACMIC36 converts more cloud water to rain (more sink). Different fromd Gettelman et al. (2014), smaller microphysics time step does not overpredict depletion in E3SM. cloud water depletion in macmic36 is mostly due to accretion. why? accretion is a function of cloud water and the rain water. Since autoconversion is a function of the cloud water and its increment is not as large as accretion, this change is mostly due to rain water amount. increase in accretion is possibly related to rain water build up. however, in the toy model, : toy model result global large-scale precipitation increases in macmic36 , and the increase is larger in stratocumulus regions need to check rain water used in accretion calculation is in-cloud rain water.

Cloud water is diagnostic variable where other water-related variables are prognostic variable. cloud water (rcm) increment calculation: \u2206qc = rcm - qc_state \u2206qc increases if the qc_state decreases but rcm does not decreas \u2206qc increases if rcm increases in cldmic36, cloud water increment does not change much because less clouds are expected to be diagnosed during CLUBB due to the removal of total water.

QCRAT is effective in cold regions with supercooled water. The limiter is effective in lower liquid amounts, and also in the place where the vapor deposition process occurs (depletes water onto ice and snow). smaller microphysics time step may overpredict depletion in E3SM. from the table (vertical integrals are integrated from 680 hPa to 1000 hPa (low-cloud levels by ISCCP)) when the time step is shorter, less cloud water become rain (less sink), but in MACMIC36 converts more cloud water to rain (more sink).

SciDAC project Motivation Phase 1 project: finding the source of error in the Energy Earth System Model (E3SM) and other global atmospheric models, especially the time integration errors in the subgrid parameterizations of atmospheric physics. Phase 2: improve the multi-time-scale process coupling while keeping the computational cost affordable. a stochastic formulation of the turbulence parameterization from the angle of accurately representing theeffects of fast processes using large timesteps. 2. About E3SM CAM vs EAM EAM (the E3SM (Energy Exascale Earth System Model) Atmosphere Model) was forked from the the Comunity Atmosphere Model (CAM; Neale et al., 2010) version 5.3. Independent development of EAM began around June 2014 with the goal of producing a tool optimized for Department of Energy (DOE) scientific and computational needs. The E3SM project is focused on modeling and assessment of environmental change occuring over the last 40 years and next 40 years in these research areas: 1. the water cycle - water cycle extremes: e.g., hurricanes, midlatitude cyclones, atmospheric rivers - water variability and availability (storms, storm tracks, blocking, snowmelt) - sea level rise issues (especially topography associated with Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet) 2. Sea level rise 3. Exploratory studies of the nitrogen and phosphorus on land biogeochemistry (BGC) Compared to CAM5.3, E3SM has: higher vertical resolution (30 levels to 72 levels) the surface layer is 20 m thick, with 15 layers between the surface and 850 hPa to better capture thin clouds, sharp gradients at top of the boundary layer, rapid changes in process rate (autoconversion, accretion, evaporation, and radiative heating rates) and cloud properties (drop size and rain rates) between 850 hPa and 500 hPa vertical grid spacing is slowly increased from 100 to 500 m to represent the variations in water vapor features and aerosol plumes that are frequently observed at scale of 500 m and less. free troposphere (above 500 hPa) up to the lower stratosphere (70 hPa) was increased from 1200 to 600 m to allow for adequate representation of upward propagating large-scale tropical waves such as Kelvin and mixed-Rossby gravity. improved treatment of some diabatic processes: Turbulence, shallow convection, and stratoform cloud macrophysics (CLUBB) and the improved representation of ice clouds (threshold size for autoconversion of ice to snow particle is a function of temperature) aerosol-cloud (stratiform and shallow convective clouds) interaction when CLUBB and MAM4 are coupled some stratospheric ozone COSP (the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project Obseration Simulator Package; Bodas-Salcedo et al., 2011) version 1.4 Time inetgration in EAM Atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs) are mainly consist of two distinct parts: the dynamical core and the physics parameterizations.Consider the general prediction equation for a generic variable \\(\\psi\\) , (1) \\(\\frac{\\partial \\psi} {\\partial t}\\) = \\(D\\left(\\psi\\right)\\) + \\(P\\left(\\psi\\right)\\) ;, \\(\\psi\\) : a prognostic variable (e.g., temperature, horizontal wind component) D: The dynamical core component P: the physical parameterization suite A hybrid physics-dyanmics coupling that uses different methods for fluid dynamics and tracer transport (Lauritzen et al., 2014) is used in EAM. (????not sure??? need more understanding on this) This method is also called as many names: \"isolated sequential splitting\" (Wan et al., 2021), \"time splitting method\" (Williamson, 2002; Lauritzen et al., 2018), \"sequential-update splitting\" (Donahue and Caldwell, 2018), and \"operator splitting\" (Sportisse, 2000). The Time Split coupling is approximated by (2) \\(\\psi^* = \\psi^{n-1} + 2\\Delta t D(\\psi^*,\\psi^{n},\\psi^{n-1}) \\;,\\) (3) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = \\psi^* + 2\\Delta t P(\\psi^{n+1},\\psi^*) \\;\\) . the time split approximations D and P are calculated sequentially, each based on the state produced by the other. In other words, a model component takes the atmospheric state variables (e.g., winds, temperature, pressure, and tracer concentrations that have already been updated by a proceding component) as inputs. Tendencies caused by the current component are calculated by considering the current component in isolation. The tendencies are then used to update the atmospheric state before passing it to the next component. EAMv1 has \"physics time step\" of 30 minutes and \"sub-cycling timestep\" of 5 minutes. Within one physics time step, the atmospheric state is updated multiple times. The schematic diagram for the time integration is as follows: The focus points of the dyanmical core and physics parameterization developmenets are different. The dynamical core developments focuses on designing accurate and computationally efficient discretization methods for modern computing architectures (see, e.g., Lauritzen et al., 2011; Williamson, 2007). In contrast, the development of physics parameterizations has a stronger emphasis on how to formulate the equations to conceptually describe a physical phenomena. For that reason (?), a number of recent studies have shown that time integration errors in the parameterizations or process coupling can be sufficiently large to dominate the total error of the numerical solutions (e.g., Barrett et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2012, 2018). To understand or to evaluate the tendency of a variable in each processes, the typical way to obtain the value is to review the model source code and manually add extra lines of code and variables into subroutines.

(????not sure??? need more understanding on this) This method is also called as many names: \"isolated sequential splitting\" (Wan et al., 2021), \"time splitting method\" (Williamson, 2002; Lauritzen et al., 2018), \"sequential-update splitting\" (Donahue and Caldwell, 2018), and \"operator splitting\" (Sportisse, 2000).

Tendencies caused by the current component are calculated by considering the current component in isolation. The tendencies are then used to update the atmospheric state before passing it to the next component. EAMv1 has \"physics time step\" of 30 minutes and \"sub-cycling timestep\" of 5 minutes. Within one physics time step, the atmospheric state is updated multiple times. The schematic diagram for the time integration is as follows: The focus points of the dyanmical core and physics parameterization developmenets are different. The dynamical core developments focuses on designing accurate and computationally efficient discretization methods for modern computing architectures (see, e.g., Lauritzen et al., 2011; Williamson, 2007). In contrast, the development of physics parameterizations has a stronger emphasis on how to formulate the equations to conceptually describe a physical phenomena. For that reason (?), a number of recent studies have shown that time integration errors in the parameterizations or process coupling can be sufficiently large to dominate the total error of the numerical solutions (e.g., Barrett et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2012, 2018).

The numerics of physical parametrization Coupling of Dynamical Core and Parameterization Suite in CAM5 Link for the documentation The CAM5.0 cleanly separates the parameterization suite from the dynamical core , and makes it easier to replace or modify each in isolation. The dynamical core can be coupled to the parameterization suite in a purely time split manner or in a purely process split one, as described below. Consider the general prediction equation for a generic variable \\(\\psi\\) , (1) \\(\\frac{\\partial \\psi} {\\partial t}\\) = \\(D\\left(\\psi\\right)\\) + \\(P\\left(\\psi\\right)\\) ;, \\(\\psi\\) : a prognostic variable (e.g., temperature, horizontal wind component) D: The dynamical core component P: the physical parameterization suite A three-time-level notation is employed which is appropriate for the semi-implicit Eulerian spectral transform dynamical core. However, the numerical characteristics of the physical parameterizations are more like those of diffusive processes rather than advective ones. They are therefore approximated with forward or backward differences, rather than centered three-time-level forms. The Process Split coupling is approximated by (2) \\(\\psi^{n+1}\\) = \\(\\psi^{n-1} + 2\\Delta t D(\\psi^{n+1},\\psi^{n},\\psi^{n-1}) + 2\\Delta t P(\\psi^*,\\psi^{n-1}) \\;,\\) where \\(P(\\psi^*,\\psi^{n-1})\\) is calculated first from (3) \\(\\psi^* = \\psi^{n-1} + 2\\Delta t P(\\psi^*,\\psi^{n-1}) \\;.\\) The Time Split coupling is approximated by (4) \\(\\psi^* = \\psi^{n-1} + 2\\Delta t D(\\psi^*,\\psi^{n},\\psi^{n-1}) \\;,\\) (5) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = \\psi^* + 2\\Delta t P(\\psi^{n+1},\\psi^*) \\;\\) . The distinction is that in the Process Split approximation the calculations of D and P are both based on the same past state, \\(\\psi^{n-1}\\) , while in the Time Split approximations D and P are calculated sequentially , each based on the state produced by the other. As mentioned above, the Eulerian core employs the three-time-level notation in eq. (2)-(5). Eqns. (2)-(5) also apply to two-time-level finite volume, semi-Lagrangian and spectral element (HOMME) cores by dropping centered n term dependencies, and replacing n-1 by n and \\(2 \\Delta t\\) by \\(\\Delta t\\) . The parameterization package can be applied to produce an updated field as indicated in Eq. (3) and Eq. (5). Thus Eq. (5) can be written with an operator notation (6) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = {\\boldsymbol{P}}\\left(\\psi^*\\right) \\;\\) , where only the past state is included in the operator dependency for notational convenience. The implicit predicted state dependency is understood. The Process Split equation (2) can also be written in operator notation as (7) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = {\\boldsymbol{D}}\\left(\\psi^{n-1}, \\frac {{\\boldsymbol{P}}(\\psi^{n-1})-\\psi^{n-1}} {2 \\Delta t} \\right) \\;\\) , \\(\\psi^{n-1}\\) : the prognostic variable input to the dynamical core \\(\\frac {{\\boldsymbol{P}}(\\psi^{n-1})-\\psi^{n-1}} {2 \\Delta t} ;\\) : the forcing rate from the parameterization package (e.g. the heating rate in the thermodynamic equation). Again only the past state is included in the operator dependency, with the implicit predicted state dependency left understood. With this notation the Time Split system (4) and (5) can be written (8) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = {\\boldsymbol{P}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{D}}\\left(\\psi^{n-1},0\\right)\\right) \\;\\) . The total parameterization package in CAM5.0 consists of a sequence of components, indicated by (9) \\(P = \\{ M,R,S,T \\} \\;\\) , M: (Moist) precipitation processes R: clouds and Radiation S: the Surface model T: Turbulent mixing. Each of these in turn is subdivided into various components: M includes an optional dry adiabatic adjustment (normally applied only in the stratosphere), moist penetrative convection, shallow convection, and large-scale stable condensation; R first calculates the cloud parameterization followed by the radiation parameterization; S provides the surface fluxes obtained from land, ocean and sea ice models, or calculates them based on specified surface conditions such as sea surface temperatures and sea ice distribution. These surface fluxes provide lower flux boundary conditions for the turbulent mixing T which is comprised of the planetary boundary layer parameterization, vertical diffusion, and gravity wave drag. Defining operators following (6) for each of the parameterization components, the couplings in CAM5.0 are summarized as: TIME SPLIT (10) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = {\\boldsymbol{T}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{S}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{R}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{M}}\\left( {\\boldsymbol{D}}\\left(\\psi^{n-1},0\\right)\\right)\\right)\\right)\\right)\\) PROCESS SPLIT (11) \\(\\psi^{n+1} = {\\boldsymbol{D}}\\left(\\psi^{n-1},\\frac { {\\boldsymbol{T}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{S}}\\left({\\boldsymbol{R}}\\left( {\\boldsymbol{M}}\\left(\\psi^{n-1}\\right)\\right)\\right)\\right) - \\psi^{n-1}} {2\\Delta t}\\right)\\) The labels Time Split and Process Split refer to the coupling of the dynamical core with the complete parameterization suite. The components within the parameterization suite are coupled via time splitting in both forms. The Process Split form is convenient for spectral transform models. With Time Split approximations extra spectral transforms are required to convert the updated momentum variables provided by the parameterizations to vorticity and divergence for the Eulerian spectral core, or to recalculate the temperature gradient for the semi-Lagrangian spectral core. The Time Split form is convenient for the finite-volume core which adopts a Lagrangian vertical coordinate. Since the scheme is explicit and restricted to small time-steps by its non-advective component, it sub-steps the dynamics multiple times during a longer parameterization time step. With Process Split approximations the forcing terms must be interpolated to an evolving Lagrangian vertical coordinate every sub-step of the dynamical core. Besides the expense involved, it is not completely obvious how to interpolate the parameterized forcing, which can have a vertical grid scale component arising from vertical grid scale clouds, to a different vertical grid.

Horizontal discretization Spectral-element dynamical core TBC Dyanmical core clipping? In E3SM, clipping was mentioned in clubb_intr.F90 An example of an inconsistency in CAM physics is that surface pressure is held fixed during physical parameterization updates, but water vapor, and hence surface pressure, does change during evaporation/precipitation and an inconsistency appears in the mass and energy budget. Similarly, if a \u201c clipper \u201d is used on water vapor or condensates to avoid (unphysical) negative mixing ratios (more details in section 3.2) and this is not accounted for in the thermodynamics or through a surface flux, that \u201c clipping \u201d will produce an energy source via the mass weightening in the TE vertical integral. In the dynamical core TE is not conserved locally in each column as there is a horizontal flux of energy between columns; but the local energy budget should, ideally, be closed and thereby, globally, TE should be conserved. If a dynamical core does not inherently conserve dry air mass and/or water mass then a spurious source of TE is inevitable again through the mass weightening in the vertical integral (unless fixers are applied).

Using a proportional rate of change allows the dilution to reflect the properties of the volume being diluted, in addition to the intensity of the process responsible for the dilution (i.e., entrainment). see Zhang et al. 2021 CAPE-based triggers are commonly used in deep convection schemes such as the ZM scheme, which is one of the common deep convection schemes used in several climate models including the NCAR CAM and the Department of Energy E3SM Atmosphere Model (EAM). undiluted CAPE is defined as the vertical integral of the local buoyancy of a parcel from the launch level to the equilibrium level. By construction, the undilute CAPE trigger scheme prevents the accumulation of instability in the atmosphere beyond the threshold value and results in generally triggering convection too frequently and too early during the day (e.g., Xie & Zhang, 2000). Neale et al. (2008) introduced the dilution effect of entrained air into the CAPE calculation (hereafter called dilute CAPE).

The closure problem of turbulence is alternately described as the requirement for an infinite number of equations, which would also be impossible to solve. This problem is apparently associated with the nonlinear nature of turbulence, and the traditional analytical approach of Reynolds averaging the governing equations to eliminate linear terms while retaining the nonlinear terms as statistical correlations of various orders (i.e., consisting of the product of multiple dependent variables). The closure problem is a long-standing unsolved problem of classical (Newtonian) physics. While no exact solution has been found to date, approximations called closure assumptions can be made to allow approximate solution of the equations for practical applications. closure assumption https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Closure_assumptions Approximations made to the Reynolds-averaged equations of turbulence to allow solutions for flow and turbulence variables. The Reynolds-averaged equations contain statistical correlations such as the variance or covariance between dependent variables such as velocity or temperature. The equations that forecast lower-order correlations often contain unknowns of higher statistical order, a difficulty known as the closure problem. When the higher-order terms are approximated as empirical functions of lower-order terms and of known independent variables, the resulting approximate equations can then be solved. These approximations, known as closure assumptions, must satisfy parameterization rules. Stull, R. B. 1988.

Similarly, if a \u201c clipper \u201d is used on water vapor or condensates to avoid (unphysical) negative mixing ratios (more details in section 3.2) and this is not accounted for in the thermodynamics or through a surface flux, that \u201c clipping \u201d will produce an energy source via the mass weightening in the TE vertical integral. In the dynamical core TE is not conserved locally in each column as there is a horizontal flux of energy between columns; but the local energy budget should, ideally, be closed and thereby, globally, TE should be conserved. If a dynamical core does not inherently conserve dry air mass and/or water mass then a spurious source of TE is inevitable again through the mass weightening in the vertical integral (unless fixers are applied).

The closure problem of turbulence is alternately described as the requirement for an infinite number of equations, which would also be impossible to solve. This problem is apparently associated with the nonlinear nature of turbulence, and the traditional analytical approach of Reynolds averaging the governing equations to eliminate linear terms while retaining the nonlinear terms as statistical correlations of various orders (i.e., consisting of the product of multiple dependent variables). The closure problem is a long-standing unsolved problem of classical (Newtonian) physics. While no exact solution has been found to date, approximations called closure assumptions can be made to allow approximate solution of the equations for practical applications. closure assumption https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Closure_assumptions Approximations made to the Reynolds-averaged equations of turbulence to allow solutions for flow and turbulence variables. The Reynolds-averaged equations contain statistical correlations such as the variance or covariance between dependent variables such as velocity or temperature. The equations that forecast lower-order correlations often contain unknowns of higher statistical order, a difficulty known as the closure problem. When the higher-order terms are approximated as empirical functions of lower-order terms and of known independent variables, the resulting approximate equations can then be solved. These approximations, known as closure assumptions, must satisfy parameterization rules. Stull, R. B. 1988.

Higher vertical resolution causes: much stronger temperature & moisture gradient in the boundary layer. allow more variation in layer stability, RH, and buoyancy (i.e., updraft plumes may penetrate more layers before reaching their level of neutral buoyancy [LNB]) drier free troposphere: because water vapor is confined to the boundary layer, in the absence of processes that mix air to higher altitudes shallower convection due to the stronger gradients (and a drier free troposhere) influencing many meteorological features (radiative heating, altitude of detraining heat, and water substances) and the moisture modes that play a significant role in equatorial wave variability. LNB (level of neutral buoyancy) calculation (or cloud top calculation) (Xie et al. 2018): resolution dependent depend strongly on the environment air properties entrained in the updraft (Neal et al. 2008) convection top is sensitive to free troposphere humidity. EAMv1 reduce the resolution dependence by terminating the CAPE calculation when the parcel encounters a single negatively buoyant layer in the plume buoyancy calculation . optional parameterization of convective gustiness: designed to represent the increase in surface wind produced in the presence of evaporating precipitation (Harrop et al., 2018) convective cloud fraction is assumed proportional to the log of the updraft mass flux (Hack et al., 1993) detraining convective condensate in partitioned into liquid and ice liquid size: inherits the stratiform cloud at the same location ice size: specified as a tunable parameter tunable parameters: timescale for calculating closure designed to reduce CAPE (essential to determine cloud base mass) timescale for conversion to precipitation (essential to generate updraft condensate mass via a saturation adjustment) downdraft coefficient: used to control the mass flux at the downdraft top and the evaporation rate of the rainfall driving the downdraft. temperature range that partitioning liquid and ice during the detrainment process due to convective updraft the lowest possible launch level (maybe buoyancy??): from surface to 100 m entrainment parameter(dmpdx): when this is reduced, depth of the convection is controlled. size of the cloud ice formed from detrainment of convective condensate Aerosol Four-mode version of the Modal Aerosol Module (MAM4; Liu et al., 2016): 1 coarse, 3 fine-particle moajor aerosol speies: sulfate, black carbon, primary organic matter, marine organic aerosol (MOA), secondary organic aerosol (SOA), mineral dust, and sea spray new representation of MOA (Burrows et al., 2014; Burrows et al., 2018) -> important step towards linking ocean BGC process with the ocean surface chemistry that determines sea spray aerosol formation. revise the simplified treatment of SOA (single-lumped-species treatment of SOA) --> by adapting SOA production sources (Shrivastava et al., 2015) explicit treatment of multigenerational gas-pase chemistry of SOA precursor gases and particle-phase transformation of SOA.

CLUBB\u00b4s turbulent kinetic energy (and corresponding cloud updraft velocities) does not currently depend directly on radiative cooling rates near cloud top and often produce weak estimated subgrid vertical velocities so a (tunable) lower limit of 0.2 m/s was chosen for the subgrid velocity used to activate liquid and ice clouds. the lower bound for IN calculation is triggered very frequently (impact is small with 0.3 W/m 2 changes in global annual mean longwave and shortwave cloud radiative effects) liquid cloud drop activation: Abdul-Razzak and Ghan (2000). ice nucleation parameterization for heterogeneous ice formation in mixed-phase cloud (Wang et al., 2014) classic nucleation theory(CNT)-based ice nucleation parameterization depends on interstitial and cloud-borne BC & dust aerosol Thresuhold size for autoconversion of ice crystals to snow particles: constant --> function of temperature Autoconversion parameterization: Khairoutdinov and Kogan (2000) represent self-collection of small liquid drops to form precipitataion size particles the tree parameters developed for that parameterization (and usually treated as fixed inviolate constants) are actually subjected to significant uncertainty depending upon cloud regime (Wood, 2005; Kogan, 2013) and have a very strong impact on aerosol indirect radiative effect( e.g., Wang et al., 2012). these values are mostly fitted using a central values for autoconversion (and accretion) choose the values that reduce radiative biases in regions with low cloud water and droplet number in the regimes other than stratocumulus regions (e.g., trade cumuli) produce less precipitation through autoconversion than the standard KK@000 treatment and are very consistent with Kogan (2013) and Beheng (1994) rates in low aerosol (cloud droplet) regimes.

Aerosol mass and number concentrations are merged with a historic inventory of volcanic aerosols wwith an assumed mean radius in the stratosphere. Aerosol optical properties for each aerosol mode (Ghan and Zaveri, 2007) are calculated after merging with historic inventory. optical properties of aerosols are combined using a \"homogeneous mixing assumption\" by volume to produce estimates of single scattering albedo, extinction, and backscatter by wavelength and then provided to the radiative transfer parameterization. Chemistry stratosperic ozone concentration: Hsu and Prather (2009, LINOZ2) Linearized production and loss coefficients characterizing sensitivity to local ozone concentration, local temperature, and the ozone column above are used to calculate stratospheric production loss terms for ozone for each decade of the 1850-2000 time period between 12 and 58 km monthly mean zonal estimates Cariolle et al. (1990): a simple parameterization for ozone depletion in the presence of polar stratospheric clouds at cold temperatures in the stratosphere. the rate of exponential decay is a function of the prescribed chlorine loading (ozone holes will only form when chlorine loading is high, and the temperature is cold enough to form polar stratospheric clouds) advected stratospheric ozone mixing ratios are then merged at the tropopause with prescribed monthly mean tropospheric ozone archived from more comprehensive chemical simulations performed with the MOZART chemical transport model as discussed in Neale et al (2010). this merged ozone distribution is then used in the radiative transfer calculation and for oxidation of aerosol precursors.

(2010) maximum vertical overlap is assumed within each of the three regimes representing low (p>700 hPa), middle (400 hPa < p < 700 hPa), and high (p < 400 hPa) clouds. random vertical overlap is assumed between these three regimes liquid cloud drop optic: Wiscombe (1996) ice cloud optics: Mitchell (2002): extended to allow for radiatively active falling snow. process for cloud A subcolumn decomposition of cloud overlap and fraction generates a set of subcolumns in which cloud is either 1 or 0 in each layer. these composited cloud and aerosol properties for each subcolumn are in turn passed to RRTMG along with concentrations of radiatively active gases. the MonteCarlo Independent Column Approximation (Pincus, Baker & Morcrette, 2003) that represents subgrid-scale cloud variability is used to calculate the heating rates and fluxes in each subcolumn for specific spectral bands; averaging each subcolumn\u00b4s radiative heating rate over time and subcolumn provides an estimate o f grid mean radiative heating rate.

Isotropic orographic source is assumed (wave amplitudes are independent of source-layer wind direction, but orographic GW wave orientations are assumed to be normal to the source-layer wind. near-surface flow nonlinearities arising from flow splitting (blocking) of downslope winds is not represented (e.g., Lott & Miller, 1997; Scinocca & McFarlane, 2004) convective (Beres et al. 2004) produced by oscillating convectivee motion with the deep convective cells launched when deep convection procuded by the ZM parameterization width and shape: a function of phase speed determined by the depth of deep convective heating (from heating profile from the ZM parameterization) amplitude: the square of the max heating in ZM scaled by a factor obstacle effect is not considered responsible for producing QBO-like fluctuation of the equatorial zonal wind , but the amplitude and period were not optimized in the current EAM and the oscillation is currently too strong frontal (Charron & Manzini, 2002) produced when the frontogenesis function (by Hoskins, 1982) is found to exceed a specified threshold at 600 hPa lanched at 500 hPa with a prespecified momentum flux amplitude. spectrum is alligned parallel to the wind at the source level (the steering level of fronts) 40 individual waves with phase speeds from U -100 to U +100 m/s are launched The spectrum is Gaussian in shape and centered on the source level wind. critical in reversing high-latitude upper-stratospheric and mesospheric jets and are ultimately responsible for producing the mesopause temperature reversal in models. the top boundary condition for GW is set so the momentum flux goes out at the model top important in the momentum budget above 40 km in the Northern Hemisphere and above 50 km in the Southern Hemisphere .

(originally designed to work at a scale of 100 km or larger) related properties: the level of the air parcel launch (liftlevel), free convection, melting, neutral buoyancy Results Cloud CLUBB led to a more realistic transition from stratocumulus to trade wind cumulus regions in the subtropical oceans in CAM5 (Bogenschutz et al., 2013) and also in EAMv1L. substantial decrease in Sc near the coasts in EAMv1: might be due to the narrow area of low vertical velocity skewness in CLUBB and the annual mean skewness is too high near Peru/Chile and Calinornian coast increase of low clouds: especially in the trade cumulus regions due to a better representation of the boundary layer structure.(see Figure2 and Figure4 in this article) problems with tuning tuning of parameter to balance the TOA radiative budget reduces low clouds: due to competition & interaction between shallow and deep convection dp1 reduction: lead to a large reduction of clouds in the low and middle levels ( cloud below 4 km) adjusting parameters such as CAPE (capeten) and the air parcel launch level (liftlevel) due to increase in vertical resolution affect Sc and Cu transition . reduction of high level cloud (drier free troposphere) --> due to high vertical resolution water vapor is more easily confined to the surface and boundary layer. excessive ice cloud and insufficient liquid cloud have been an outstanding issue in CAM5 (Kay et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2013). IWP simulated by EAMv1L (11.64 g m -2 ) is significantly smaller than that produced by EAMv0 (31.70 g m -2 ) due to change of the ice-to-snow autoconversion scheme . substantially weaker LWCF over the TWP due to less high cloud cover. Precipitation excessive precipiation over large portions of the tropic, Arabian Sea, Pacific ITCZ, the subtropical oceans, Nortwestern Indian Ocean and Africa. less precipitation over Amazon, TWP, and South China Sea. (mostly due to tuning) Temperature & Moisture cold biases in the upper troposphere in the tropical and subtropical regions moistures are trapped in the lower levels, drier mid/upper troposphere. Impact of tuning parameter \"capeten\" and Air Parcel Launch Level in ZM capeten: the number of negative buoyancy layers that deep convection can penetrate. adjustment leads to: overall: negative on high clouds & tropical precipitation increase in low clouds in the Sc/Cu transition region decrease of low clouds along the equatorial deep convection region (reduction up to 15%) tropical convection is substantially suppressed over the TWP & Eastern Pacific warm pool off the central Americal coast (reduced high cloud & LWCF) enhanced precipitation and high clod over tropical lands & adjacent oceans (increase in LWCF) significant cloud reduction above 6 km is due to the higher cloud launch level. Summary Overall improvement in comparison with EAMv0 1) cloud products - increased stratocumulus (except near the coasts) and trade-wind cumulus - better transition from Sc to Cu 2) reduced biases in LWCF, especially over tropical land and adjacent ocean 3) notably improved precipitation over the oceans adjacent to the indian peninsula and tropical eastern Indian ocean. remaining problems due to CLUBB, MG2: dry biases over the Amazon region substantial reduction of Sc off the west coast of major continents in the subtropics largely reduced high clouds over TWP lack of low and middle level clouds over deep convection regions dry bias in TWP and South East Asia. CLUBB led to an initial reduction of stratocumulus clouds Impact of increasing vertical resolution large reduction of high cloud over tropical deep convection regimes (weaker LWCF over TWP) excessive precipitation in the tropics increase of Sc off the west coasts of Nort and South America But, tuning parameter leads to an overall increase of high clouds and reduction of low and middle clouds in the tropical region Impact of increasing horizontal resolution decrease in cloud and precipitation field (weaker SWCF and LWCF) in the tropical and subtropical regions stronger precipitation in ITCZ But, tuning parameter leads to improve clouds and precipitation, including notable increase of Sc.

The definition of individual sources of water conservation error can be found in Sect. 3. increase in vertical resolution: increase QNEG4 error due to thinner surface layer -> clipping more surface moisture flux use of CLUBB&MG2: the incorrect relationship between the surface moisture flux and latent heat flux used at the EAM-CLUBB interface (LHFLX). update land model: positive QNEG4 due to the surface moisture flux changes. ^^ the PDC erros in V1 \\(\\alpha\\) systematically occur in cloudy regions with a strong horizontal gradient in cloud condensate.^^ the LHFLX errors typically occurs in middle and high latitudes due to the lower surface temperature there and the more frequent occurrence of ice sublimation and deposition.","title":"result"},{"location":"99_Personal_notes/05_references/Zhang_et_al_2018_GMD/#resolusion-sensitivity","text":"Mainly PDC, QNEG4 and QNEG3 negative concentrations are often caused by a dynamical or physical process predicting a strong sink (due to the assumptions for tracer persistency) spacial resolution: sharper spatial gradient -> strong local sink leads to more clipping the increased temporal resolution will lead to an overall reduction of the water conservation error. these errors seem to be insignificant to the climate.","title":"resolusion sensitivity"},{"location":"99_Personal_notes/05_references/Zhang_et_al_2019_JAMES/","text":"Zhang et al.

E3SM generally underestimate low latitude clouds (due to the underestimate of optically thin to intermediate cloud underpredict marine stratocumulus along the coast & high clouds over the tropical deep convection region. underestimated thin clouds results in too much longwave radiation being emitted to space and too little shortwave radiation being reflected back to space. overestimate Arctic clouds (overestimates optically intermediate to thick clouds) results in too little longwave radiation being emitted to space and too much shortwave radiation being reflected back to space. produces more supercooled liquid cloud fraction than CAM5 and other CMIP5 model primarily due to a new ice nucleation scheme and secondarily due to a reduction of the ice deposition growth rate. COSP COSP version 1.4 is satellite simulator that included in EAMv1 to emulate the algorithms used by the ISCCP (Rossow and Schiffer, 1999), MODIS, MISR, CALIPSO, and CloudSat.

Due to attenuation of the CALIPSO depolarization signal, it is hard to derive reliable cloud phase. More details are provided in Cesana and Chepfer (2013).
