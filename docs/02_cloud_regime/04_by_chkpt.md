# By Check Points

## RAD

* at 850 hPa: subtropical low-level cloud
    - cooling from stratocumulus cloud top are the strongest.
    - cooling also comes from storm track cloud top, but the effect is smaller than stratocumulus regions

|--------------|------|-------------|------|
| overall      | strong vertical transport due to Hadley cell | near surface upward transport due to PBL turbulence (buoyancy due to strong Latent heat flux) | - near surface Horizontal temperature advection <br> - accumulation of heat above the cloud top due to descending air |

| T            | decrease due to ascending air | decrease due to ascending air near surface | - cloud bottom: deccrease due to ascending air <br> - cloud top: increase due to descending air |

## CLUBB

| | ITCZ | Storm Track | Stratocumulus |
|---|----|----|----|
| Q | - surface evaporation<br> - transport due to convection| - strong shallow convection <b> - decrease in Q due to well-developed cyclones | - surface evaporation <br> - turbulent mixing within boundary layer|
| T | - surface latent & sensible heat flux <br> - some condensational heating | similar with ITCZ | - cloud bottom: surface latent & sensible heat flux & turbulent mixing at BL<br> - cloud top: evaporative cooling due to entrainment
| Cloud water | cloud formation around 400 hPa due to tall cloud | - mostly forming low level cloud<br> - mid & high level clouds are forming due to well developed cyclone | - stratocumulus: strong low-level cloud <br> - trade cumulus: clouds are forming at more higer layers due to shallow convection |
| wind | decrease in wind speed due to turbulence within boundary layer |||
