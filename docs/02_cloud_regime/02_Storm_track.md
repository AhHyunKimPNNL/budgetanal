# Storm Track

* Strong seasonalities are shown
    - affect large-scale synoptic pressure pattern
    - surface temperature (affect buoyancy caused by strong LH flux) ![ocean current](https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/facts/media/climate-800.jpg)
* Cloud radiative cooling occurs mostly above the low-level clouds
* Well-developed synoptic scale cyclone causes upward motions
    - cooling in DYNEND, DEEPCU (convection), and CLUBB (shallow convection)
    - convection also affect ice formation
